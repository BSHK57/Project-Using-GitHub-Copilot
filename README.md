# Face Detection Video Project (Created Fully with GitHub Copilot AI)

This project demonstrates real-time face detection from a webcam video stream using Python and OpenCV. **Every part of this project was generated and implemented using GitHub Copilot AI, with no manual code written by a human.**

## Features
- Real-time face detection using Haar cascades
- Modular code structure (camera, face detection, utilities)
- Simple and clean codebase
- Easy to run on any system with Python and OpenCV

## Folder Structure
```
face-detection-video/
  src/
    camera.py           # Handles webcam video capture
    face_detector.py    # Detects faces in video frames
    main.py             # Main entry point for running the app
    utils.py            # Utility functions (drawing, resizing, etc.)
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```powershell
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Project-Using-GitHub-Copilot-
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the `src` directory:
   ```powershell
   cd face-detection-video/src
   ```
2. Run the main script:
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```
3. A window will open showing the webcam feed with rectangles drawn around detected faces. Press `q` to quit.
